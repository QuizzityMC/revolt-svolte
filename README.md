### A Svelte-DaisyUI template.

This template includes Svelte with TypeScript support and DaisyUI as a postcss plugin.

It also includes autoprefixer and uses esbuild to build the client.

Simply `pnpm i` and then `pnpm start` and go to [localhost:7859](http://localhost:7859)

#### Standalone Build

Svolte supports being built 'standalone'. This means it does not rely on the backend proxy server.

Just run `pnpm run standalone` and a standalone version will be built in `dist`.
